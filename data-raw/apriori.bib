	abstract = {{IUCN} Red List assessments are essential for prioritizing conservation needs but are resourceintensive and therefore only available for a fraction of global species richness. Tropical plant species are particularly under-represented on the {IUCN} Red List. Automated conservation assessments based on digitally available geographic occurrence records can be a rapid alternative, but it is unclear how reliable these assessments are. Here, we present automated conservation assessments for 13,910 species of the diverse and globally distributed Orchid family (Orchidaceae), based on a novel method using a deep neural network ({IUC}-{NN}), most of which (13,049) were previously unassessed by the {IUCN} Red List. We identiﬁed 4,342 (31.2 \% of the evaluated orchid species) as Possibly Threatened with extinction (equivalent to the {IUCN} categories {CR}, {EN}, or {VU}) and point to Madagascar, East Africa, south-east Asia, and several oceanic islands as priority areas for orchid conservation. Furthermore, the Orchid family provides a model, to test the sensitivity of automated assessment methods to issues with data availability, data quality and geographic sampling bias. {IUC}-{NN} identiﬁed threatened species with an accuracy of 84.3\%, with signiﬁcantly lower geographic evaluation bias compared to the {IUCN} Red List, and was robust against low data availability and geographic errors in the input data. Overall, our results demonstrate that automated assessments have an important role to play in achieving goals of identifying the species that are at greatest risk of extinction.},

One of the most frequently used systems for selecting priority areas is the Key Biodiversity Areas (hereafter {KBAs}), developed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature ({IUCN}). However, {KBAs} cannot be used to rank areas, potentially limiting their use when limited funding is available. To tackle this shortcoming and facilitate spatial prioritization, here we develop and validate the “{WEGE} index” (Weighted Endemism including Global Endangerment index), consisting of an adaptation of the {EDGE} score (Evolutionarily Distinct and Globally Endangered). {WEGE} allows the ranking of any set of locations according to the {KBA} guidelines and on a continuous scale.},

To better understand the potential consequences of megafaunal loss, here we quantify their current functional diversity, predict future changes under different extinction scenarios, and introduce a new metric [functionally unique, specialized and endangered ({FUSE})] that identifies threatened species of particular importance for functional diversity. Simulated extinction scenarios forecast marked declines in functional richness if current trajectories are maintained during the next century (11\% globally; up to 24\% regionally), with more marked reductions (48\% globally; up to 70\% at the poles) beyond random expectations if all threatened species eventually go extinct. Among the megafaunal groups, sharks will incur a disproportionate loss of functional richness. We identify top {FUSE} species and suggest a renewed focus on these species to preserve the ecosystem functions provided by marine megafauna.},

We describe a technique to quantify how much each species is likely to contribute to future biodiversity, as measured by its expected contribution to phylogenetic diversity. Our approach considers all possible scenarios for the set of species that will be extant at some future time, and weights them according to their likelihood under an independent (but not identical) distribution on species extinctions. Although the number of extinction scenarios can typically be very large, we show that there is a simple algorithm that will quickly compute this index. The method is implemented and applied to the prosimian primates as a test case, and the associated species ranking is compared to a related measure (the ‘Shapley index’). We describe indices for rooted and unrooted trees, and a modiﬁcation that also includes the focal taxon’s probability of extinction and which links two complementary approaches to conserving phylogenetic diversity.},

Understanding, preserving, and restoring connectivity in complex landscapes requires connectivity models and metrics that are reliable, efﬁcient, and process based. We introduce a new class of ecological connectivity models based in electrical circuit theory. Although they have been applied in other disciplines, circuit-theoretic connectivity models are new to ecology. They offer distinct advantages over common analytic connectivity models, including a theoretical basis in random walk theory and an ability to evaluate contributions of multiple dispersal pathways. Resistance, current, and voltage calculated across graphs or raster grids can be related to ecological processes (such as individual movement and gene ﬂow) that occur across large population networks or landscapes. Efﬁcient algorithms can quickly solve networks with millions of nodes, or landscapes with millions of raster cells. Here we review basic circuit theory, discuss relationships between circuit and random walk theories, and describe applications in ecology, evolution, and conservation. We provide examples of how circuit models can be used to predict movement patterns and fates of random walkers in complex landscapes and to identify important habitat patches and movement corridors for conservation planning.},

Conservation resources are limited and must be directed toward the species and ecosystems that are most vulnerable, biologically distinct, likely to respond favorably to conservation interventions, and valuable ecologically, socially, or economically. Many prioritization and vulnerability assessment schemes exist, each emphasizing different types of vulnerabilities and values and often yielding disparate evaluations of the same species. We developed an integrative and ﬂexible framework that incorporates existing assessments and is useful for illuminating the differences between systems such as the {IUCN} Red List, the {US} Endangered Species Act, and {NatureServe}’s Conservation Status Assessment and Climate Change Vulnerability Index. The Standardized Index of Vulnerability and Value Assessment ({SIVVA}) includes ﬁve advancements over existing tools: (1) the ability to import criteria and data from previous assessments, (2) explicit attention to {SLR}, (3) a ﬂexible system of scoring, (4) metrics for both vulnerability and conservation value, and (5) quantitative and transparent accounting of multiple sources of uncertainty. We apply this system to 40 species in Florida previously identiﬁed as being vulnerable to {SLR} by the year 2100, describe the inﬂuence of different types of uncertainty on the resulting prioritizations, and explore the power of {SIVVA} to evaluate alternative prioritization schemes. This type of assessment is particularly relevant in low-lying coastal regions where vulnerability to {SLR} is predictable, severe, and likely to interact synergistically with other threats such as coastal development.},

The analysis both increases our understanding of conservation strategies and provides a tool for supporting their use in decision making. It facilitates answering such questions as: What are the basic characteristics of the strategy? What are its biological targets? What are its aims, paths of inﬂuence and expected beneﬁts? Where should the strategy best be applied and by whom? How should the strategy be applied over time? What are the data needs? What major assumptions underlie the strategy? Which are the major costs, constraints, and uncertainties that might inﬂuence its feasibility and application? How does the strategy relate to other conservation strategies? Are there viable alternatives? We also examine the emergent properties of the strategy, asking what the world would be like if the strategy was applied extensively. We examine the usefulness of structured analysis by applying it to the strategy of temporary conservation, which incorporates dynamic reserves and temporary conservation contracts, either to maintain a regional distribution of successional habitats or to facilitate climate-change induced range shifts of species. This application showed that these strategies have appeared under various names, that they require extensive data, that implementation involves signiﬁcant uncertainties, and that associated uncertainties increase through time. Applying the proposed framework to a range of conservation strategies would improve our ability to identify most appropriate paths of conservation when many alternatives exist.},
