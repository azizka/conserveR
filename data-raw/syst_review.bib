	abstract = {We demonstrate a novel method for spatial conservation prioritization at a community-level that takes account of: (i) an environmentally-based classiﬁcation of the landscape into community classes; (ii) similarities between community classes to allow for community complementarity-based selection; (iii) variation in species richness; (iv) variation in human impacts on ecological integrity; and (v) requirements for maintenance of upstream–downstream connectivity in riverine systems. While this technique has generic application, we demonstrate its application using a biologically-trained environmental classiﬁcation of New Zealand’s river network. Our analysis produces a priority ranking of planning units (here 4th order catchments or sub-catchments) and performance estimates in terms of expected biodiversity returns given varying degrees of geographic protection. Accounting for community similarity ensures high protection for distinct habitat classes with low similarity to other classes; our results indicate a 28\% loss in conservation efﬁciency of the highest-ranked 10\% of the landscape if it is ignored. Accounting for human pressures and connectivity also had clear inﬂuences on spatial priority rankings, indicating the need to consider these factors in the conservation planning process.},

	abstract = {Applicability of modeling tools to tackle conservation problems is key for conservation planning. However, modeling papers regarding real-world conservation issues are scarce. Here, we combined two modeling tools to identify priority areas in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, focusing on the last large-bodied frugivorous bird in the region, the red-billed curassow (Crax blumenbachii). We used population viability analysis ({PVA}) to determine (1) the minimum viable population size under different hunting scenarios; and (2) the minimum critical forest patch size required to maintain viable populations. We used ecological niche modeling ({ENM}) to identify remnants that retain suitable environmental conditions to ensure the long-term persistence of this species. We overlapped the outputs from {PVA} and {ENM} models to identify priority areas for curassows. Under our best-case scenario, 56 individuals would sufﬁce to maintain a viable population and 71 forest patches located within the species' known range are above the critical size of 3141 ha. In the worst-case scenario, at least 138 individuals would be required to maintain a viable population in forest patches larger than 9500 ha, corresponding to only 20 Atlantic Forest fragments within the species range. Among these, 17 presented median habitat suitability values higher than 0.70, eight of which were selected as priority areas for law enforcement and nine as priority areas for reintroduction. We encourage conservation biologists and land managers to combine modeling tools which can be guided by our conservation planning framework. This approach is promising to inform long-term conservation planning of a ﬂagship species and its entire ecosystem.},

	abstract = {The Convention on Biological Diversity ({CBD}) has adopted a scheme of using scientiﬁc criteria for identifying ‘Ecologically or Biologically Signiﬁcant Marine Areas’ ({EBSAs}) in need of protection in openocean and deep-sea habitats. To date, expert opinion collated during regional workshops has been the main method to identify regional {EBSAs}. In this paper, we propose a new method that could complement this process by adding more objective and transparent analyses. There are four main steps: 1) identify the area to be examined, 2) determine appropriate datasets and thresholds to use in the evaluation, 3) evaluate data for each area/habitat against a set of criteria, and 4) identify and assess candidate {EBSAs}. The method can be applied to any habitat, but offshore seamounts were chosen as a test habitat to develop and evaluate it. Several options for various combinations of criteria are presented, with one being proposed as the most appropriate to identify a tractable number of seamounts that satisﬁed the {EBSA} criteria and which could be combined into larger areas that represent meaningful ecological and practicable management units. This option selects seamounts that meet any one of the 5 “biological” criteria (i.e. unique/rare, diverse, productive, threatened species, critical habitat) and which contain environmental features that are vulnerable to human activities but not yet signiﬁcantly impacted by them. This selection process resulted in 83 seamounts being identiﬁed from over 3000 evaluated in the South Paciﬁc Ocean. The priority seamounts group into 10 areas, consisting of 5 clusters of seamounts, and 5 individual seamounts. The primary strength of the method is the adoption of a transparent, and logically sequential, selection process that is conceptually transferrable to other habitat types and regions beyond our model system. We contend that in a global {EBSA} context it can be a useful tool to assist deepsea management.},

Its stages include development of an ecologically based model of conservation value, data pre-processing, spatial prioritization analysis, and interpretation of results for conservation action. Here we investigate the details of each stage for analyses done using the Zonation prioritization framework. While there is much literature about analytical methods implemented in Zonation, there is only scattered information available about what happens before and after the computational analysis. Here we ﬁll this information gap by summarizing the pre-analysis and post-analysis stages of the Zonation framework. Concerning the entire process, we summarize the full workﬂow and list examples of operational best-case, worstcase, and typical scenarios for each analysis stage. We discuss resources needed in different analysis stages. We also discuss beneﬁts, disadvantages, and risks involved in the application of spatial prioritization from the perspective of different stakeholders. Concerning pre-analysis stages, we explain the development of the ecological model and discuss the setting of priority weights and connectivity responses. We also explain practical aspects of data pre-processing and the post-processing interpretation of results for different conservation objectives. This work facilitates well-informed design and application of Zonation analyses for the purpose of spatial conservation planning. It should be useful for both scientists working on conservation related research as well as for practitioners looking for useful tools for conservation resource allocation.},

Green corridors that connect isolated remnant habitat patches (e.g. parks) can increase connectivity and provide ecosystem services in cities. In the current study, we introduce an open-source {ArcGIS} toolset, the Gravity model toolbox, a programmed {ArcGIS} tool to map and prioritize the potential green corridors. The new toolset is based on the least-cost modelling and the improved gravity model, comprising of two script tools, the gravity model tool, and the network analysis tool. The gravity model tool can produce a spatially-explicit map of potential corridors for urban green space, as well as prioritize these corridors considering the opportunity cost. The network analysis tool is aimed at offering multiple scenarios of corridor networks based on the demands of users. To elucidate how the toolbox could be used by the urban planners and ecology researchers, a case study of the toolbox was conducted in the Tongzhou District, Beijing, China. This study presents a novel approach to assess urban connectivity and a systematic methodology for planning greening networks that connects landscape ecology with practical planning and designing considerations to maximize social and ecological functions of urban green space.},

	abstract = {Systematic conservation planning research has focused on designing systems of conservation areas that efﬁciently protect a comprehensive and representative set of species and habitats. Recently, there has been an emphasis on improving the adequacy of conservation area design to promote the persistence and future generation of biodiversity. Few studies have explored incorporating ecological and evolutionary processes into conservation planning assessments. Biodiversity in Australia is maintained and generated by numerous ecological and evolutionary processes at various spatial and temporal scales. We accommodated ecological and evolutionary processes in four ways: (1) using sub-catchments as planning units to facilitate the protection of the integrity and function of ecosystem processes occurring on a sub-catchment scale; (2) targeting one type of ecological refugia, drought refugia, which are critical for the persistence of many species during widespread drought; (3) targeting one type of evolutionary refugia which are important for maintaining and generating unique biota during long-term climatic changes; and (4) preferentially grouping priority areas along vegetated waterways to account for the importance of connected waterways and associated riparian areas in maintaining processes. We identiﬁed drought refugia, areas of relatively high and regular herbage production in arid and semiarid Australia, from estimates of gross primary productivity derived from satellite data. In this paper, we combined the novel incorporation of these processes with a more traditional framework of efﬁciently representing a comprehensive sample of biodiversity to identify spatial priorities across Australia. We explored the trade-offs between economic costs, representation targets, and connectivity. Priority areas that considered ecological and evolutionary processes were more connected along vegetated waterways and were identiﬁed for a small increase in economic cost. Priority areas for conservation investment are more likely to have long-term beneﬁts to biodiversity if ecological and evolutionary processes are considered in their identiﬁcation.},

In this study we investigated whether the multi-scale Modiﬁed Whittaker plot ({MWP}) method is suited for vascular plant surveys as a basis for habitat assessment. We measured total and endangered species richness in ten urban forests in Hannover, Germany. The {MWPsı}´ time efﬁciency and effectiveness in capturing species richness were quantiﬁed and compared to complete ﬁeld surveys. The {MWP} method estimated both greater and lower species numbers per habitat, the absolute deviation ranged from +60 to −15 species. It generally captured fewer endangered plant species than the complete ﬁeld survey. In particular, the method did not detect species with a high category of endangerment. Regarding time efﬁciency, the {MWP} method took an average of 186 minutes per habitat, while the complete ﬁeld surveys were more time consuming (mean = 265 minutes). In small habitats ({\textless}1.0 ha) the full survey took less time than the {MWP} method. To determine the applicability for nature conservation and ecological planning, we evaluated the species data derived from the two methods by using common habitat evaluation criteria. In most cases, the species data received from the {MWP} method resulted in lower habitat values compared to the use of data from the full surveys. We conclude that comprehensive habitat evaluation exceeds the applicability of the {MWP} method which may miss locally rare species. However, the {MWP} method provides an opportunity to efﬁciently estimate plant species richness patterns in urban forests and, thus, holds the potential to convey basic information for an overall monitoring of species diversity and may lead to speciﬁc habitat assessment efforts.},

	abstract = {Using benthic habitat data from the Florida Keys ({USA}), we demonstrate how siting algorithms can help identify potential networks of marine reserves that comprehensively represent target habitat types. We applied a ﬂexible optimization tool—simulated annealing—to represent a ﬁxed proportion of different marine habitat types within a geographic area. We investigated the relative inﬂuence of spatial information, planningunit size, detail of habitat classiﬁcation, and magnitude of the overall conservation goal on the resulting network scenarios. With this method, we were able to identify many adequate reserve systems that met the conservation goals, e.g., representing at least 20\% of each conservation target (i.e., habitat type) while fulﬁlling the overall aim of minimizing the system area and perimeter. One of the most useful types of information provided by this siting algorithm comes from an ‘‘irreplaceability analysis,’’ which is a count of the number of times unique planning units were included in reserve system scenarios. This analysis indicated that many different combinations of sites produced networks that met the conservation goals. While individual 1-km2 areas were fairly interchangeable, the irreplaceability analysis highlighted larger areas within the planning region that were chosen consistently to meet the goals incorporated into the algorithm. Additionally, we found that reserve systems designed with a high degree of spatial clustering tended to have considerably less perimeter and larger overall areas in reserve—a conﬁguration that may be preferable particularly for sociopolitical reasons. This exercise illustrates the value of using the simulated annealing algorithm to help site marine reserves: the approach makes efﬁcient use of available resources, can be used interactively by conservation decision makers, and offers biologically suitable alternative networks from which an effective system of marine reserves can be crafted.},

	abstract = {Several schemes have been developed to help select the locations of marine reserves. All of them combine social, economic, and biological criteria, and few offer any guidance as to how to prioritize among the criteria identiﬁed. This can imply that the relative weights given to different criteria are unimportant. Where two sites are of equal value ecologically, then socioeconomic criteria should dominate the choice of which should be protected. However, in many cases, socioeconomic criteria are given equal or greater weight than ecological considerations in the choice of sites. This can lead to selection of reserves with little biological value that fail to meet many of the desired objectives. To avoid such a possibility, we develop a series of criteria that allow preliminary evaluation of candidate sites according to their relative biological values in advance of the application of socioeconomic criteria. We include criteria that, while not strictly biological, have a strong inﬂuence on the species present or ecological processes. Our scheme enables sites to be assessed according to their biodiversity, the processes which underpin that diversity, and the processes that support ﬁsheries and provide a spectrum of other services important to people. Criteria that capture biodiversity values include biogeographic representation, habitat representation and heterogeneity, and presence of species or populations of special interest (e.g., threatened species). Criteria that capture sustainability of biodiversity and ﬁshery values include the size of reserves necessary to protect viable habitats, presence of exploitable species, vulnerable life stages, connectivity among reserves, links among ecosystems, and provision of ecosystem services to people. Criteria measuring human and natural threats enable candidate sites to be eliminated from consideration if risks are too great, but also help prioritize among sites where threats can be mitigated by protection. While our criteria can be applied to the design of reserve networks, they also enable choice of single reserves to be made in the context of the attributes of existing protected areas. The overall goal of our scheme is to promote the development of reserve networks that will maintain biodiversity and ecosystem functioning at large scales. The values of ecosystem goods and services for people ultimately depend on meeting this objective.},

However, most research has focused on habitat quality, and we still lack approaches for tracking habitat quality dynamics. In this paper, by establishing qualitative and quantitative relationships between waterbird populations and key habitat indicators such as water abundance, food, shelter conditions and disturbance, we developed an object-oriented classification method, in conjunction with a geographic information systems ({GIS}) based centroid moving method, to assess habitat suitability dynamics for waterbirds at the Momoge Nature Reserve, China. Our results showed that habitat suitability improved during 1990–2000 and declined during 2000– 2014. Habitats with very good and good grades increased by 71.47 km2 (4.88\%) during 1990–2000 and decreased by 200.66 km2 (13.78\%) during 2000–2014. The habitat area with a good grade moved to the north, while the habitat area with a poor grade moved to the south during 1990–2014. This was mainly because the surrounding cropland area increased and shifted as oil and gas projects developed. These findings suggest that our object-oriented classification and centroid moving methods have great potential for use in biodiversity conservation and ecosystem management.},

	abstract = {The identiﬁcation of important habitats for wildlife is essential in order to plan and promote strategies for longterm eﬀective conservation. Caves and subterranean habitats are frequently overlooked habitats with diverse communities, which are frequently endemic to a region, karst outcrop or even a single cave. These cave species include a wide range of taxa adapted to cave environments. Within cave systems, bats are key providers of energy for other cave-dependent species. However, identifying caves for conservation prioritisation requires an understanding of cave-dwelling species diversity, patterns of endemism, and conservation status, in addition to a standard mechanism to evaluate risk. In this paper, we present the ‘Bat Cave Vulnerability Index’ ({BCVI}) as a standard index for evaluating bat caves for conservation prioritisation by determining Biotic Potential ({BP}) and Biotic Vulnerability ({BV}) of caves. The Biotic Potential is represented by various species diversity and rarity measurements. The Biotic Vulnerability is represented by the cave geophysical characteristics and human-induced disturbance present. Pilot testing in the southern Philippines has demonstrated that the index is an effective and practicable method to identify bat caves for conservation prioritisation. The biotic potential variables assess the presence of endemic, rare, and threatened bat species and assays the priority level based on an equation. Relative risk and vulnerability were assayed using landscape vulnerability variables, which showed anthropogenic activities were important factors in conservation prioritisation. The application and mechanism of the index potentially provides a valuable, rapid and simple assessment tool in cave conservation with special relevance to bat diversity and vulnerability. Furthermore, the multiple and holistic criteria of the {BCVI}, and the accessible information for both biotic and landscape features can be adapted to prioritise caves in a wider scale in the tropics, and in other regions with diverse cave ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Explicitly including cost in marine conservation planning is essential for achieving feasible and efficient conservation outcomes. Yet, spatial priorities for marine conservation are still often based solely on biodiversity hotspots, species richness, and/or cumulative threat maps. This study aims to provide an approach for including cost when planning large-scale Marine Protected Area ({MPA}) networks that span multiple countries. Here, we explore the incorporation of cost in the complex setting of the Mediterranean Sea. In order to include cost in conservation prioritization, we developed surrogates that account for revenue from multiple marine sectors: commercial fishing, noncommercial fishing, and aquaculture. Such revenue can translate into an opportunity cost for the implementation of an {MPA} network. Using the software Marxan, we set conservation targets to protect 10\% of the distribution of 77 threatened marine species in the Mediterranean Sea. We compared nine scenarios of opportunity cost by calculating the area and cost required to meet our targets. We further compared our spatial priorities with those that are considered consensus areas by several proposed prioritization schemes in the Mediterranean Sea, none of which explicitly considers cost. We found that for less than 10\% of the Sea's area, our conservation targets can be achieved while incurring opportunity costs of less than 1\%. In marine systems, we reveal that area is a poor cost surrogate and that the most effective surrogates are those that account for multiple sectors or stakeholders. Furthermore, our results indicate that including cost can greatly influence the selection of spatial priorities for marine conservation of threatened species. Although there are known limitations in multinational large-scale planning, attempting to devise more systematic and rigorous planning methods is especially critical given that collaborative conservation action is on the rise and global financial crisis restricts conservation investments.},

We employed a heuristic approach derived from qualitative scores provided by 10 experts on the avifauna of the region to choose the ﬁnal index among a group of candidates. This index was used to generate two maps of conservation value at 10 9 10 km resolution, one comprising all breeding bird species in the study region (219 species), and a second one with only those bird species for which ﬁne-grained maps (500 9 500 m) were also available (182 species). In spite of the difference in the number of species included in the two 10 9 10 km maps, we found similar geographical patterns and therefore we considered that the pattern shown by the second group of species (at 500 9 500 m resolution) represented a good proxy of the whole breeding avifauna for landscape planning purposes. The approach developed in this study may be particularly helpful in landscape planning outside protected areas because of its spatial continuity, ﬁnegrained resolution and easy interpretation.},

	abstract = {Ecosystem services, i.e., services provided to humans from ecological systems have become a key issue of this century in resource management, conservation planning, and environmental decision analysis. Mapping and quantifying ecosystem services have become strategic national interests for integrating ecology with economics to help understand the effects of human policies and actions and their subsequent impacts on both ecosystem function and human well-being. Some aspects of biodiversity are valued by humans in varied ways, and thus are important to include in any assessment that seeks to identify and quantify the beneﬁts of ecosystems to humans. Some biodiversity metrics clearly reﬂect ecosystem services (e.g., abundance and diversity of harvestable species), whereas others may reﬂect indirect and difﬁcult to quantify relationships to services (e.g., relevance of species diversity to ecosystem resilience, cultural value of native species). Wildlife habitat has been modeled at broad spatial scales and can be used to map a number of biodiversity metrics. In the present study, we present an approach that (1) identiﬁes mappable biodiversity metrics that are related to ecosystem services or other stakeholder concerns, (2) maps these metrics throughout a large multi-state region, and (3) compares the metric values obtained for selected watersheds within the regional context. The broader focus is to design a ﬂexible approach for mapping metrics to produce a national-scale product. We map 20 biodiversity metrics reﬂecting ecosystem services or other aspects of biodiversity for all vertebrate species except ﬁsh. Metrics include species richness for all vertebrates, speciﬁc taxon groups, harvestable species (i.e., upland game, waterfowl, furbearers, small game, and big game), threatened and endangered species, and state-designated species of greatest conservation need, and also a metric for ecosystem (i.e., land cover) diversity. The project is being conducted at multiple scales in a phased approach, starting with placebased studies, then multi-state regional areas, culminating into a national-level atlas. As an example of this incremental approach, we provide results for the southwestern United States (i.e., states of Arizona, New Mexico, Nevada, Utah, and Colorado) and portions of two watersheds within this region: the San Pedro River (Arizona) and Rio Grande River (New Mexico). Geographic patterns differed considerably among metrics across the southwestern study area, but metric values for the two watershed study areas were generally greater than those for the southwestern region as a whole.},

A criticism of risk assessments based solely on these models is that information on species ecological and life history traits is lacking. Accordingly, we developed a points-based framework for assessing species vulnerability to climate change that considered species traits together with the projections of {SDMs}. Applying this method to the Australian elapid snakes (family Elapidae), we determined which species may be particularly susceptible in the future and assessed broad-scale biogeographic patterns in species vulnerability. By offering a more comprehensive and rigorous method for assessing vulnerability than those based solely on {SDMs}, this framework provides greater justiﬁcation for resource allocation, and can help guide decisions regarding the most appropriate adaptation strategies.},

	abstract = {Wildlife resources are an important part of China's natural resources. China has a vast territory and abundant resources, and is in the leading position in wildlife resources in the world. Despite our vast territory, there are still many shortcomings in wildlife resources management, and there is still a big gap compared with European and American countries. Wildlife resources are an important part of China's natural resources. Due to the rapid development of China's economy and the sustained growth of population, wildlife populations and habitats continue to be destroyed, leading to the extinction of some species. Conservation of these endangered rare wildlife is one of the main contents of biodiversity conservation in China. As the scope of human social activities continues to expand, the quality of wildlife habitats and the safety of ecosystems are seriously threatened, and the number of rare and endangered species is greatly reduced or even extinct. In this paper, remote sensing technology is used to monitor the experimental area remotely and obtain the real-time environmental changes in the experimental area. Moreover, based on the domestic {GF}-1 remote sensing satellite images from 2010 to 2018, the habitat elements (ecosystem structure, water resources, human activities and roads) were extracted. To provide data for adaptive habitat change of wildlife. {OIF} method is used to obtain the best data factors of remote sensing data. Finally, the suitability of wildlife habitat in the experimental area is evaluated by combining remote sensing data with evaluation model, and its dynamic changes are analyzed. The experimental analysis shows that the adaptive habitat area in this area has been decreasing, and the ecological environment has become increasingly unbalanced. This study provides guidance for the conservation of biodiversity in nature reserves and the maintenance of ecosystem balance.},

	abstract = {Climate change impact on species is commonly assessed by predicting species' range change, a measure of a species' extrinsic exposure. However, this is only one dimension of species' vulnerability to climate change. Spatial arrangement of suitable habitats (e.g., fragmentation), their degree of protection or human disturbance, as well as species' intrinsic sensitivity, such as climatic tolerances, are often neglected. Here, we consider components of species' intrinsic sensitivity to climate change (climatic niche specialization and marginality) together with components of extrinsic exposure (changes in range extent, fragmentation, coverage of protected areas, and human footprint) to develop an integrated vulnerability index to climate change for world's freshwater otters. As top freshwater predators, otters are among the most vulnerable mammals, with most species being threatened by habitat loss and degradation. All dimensions of climate change exposure were based on present and future predictions of species distributions. Annual mean temperature, mean diurnal temperature range, mean temperature of the wettest quarter, precipitation during the wettest quarter, and precipitation seasonality prove the most important variables for otters. All species are vulnerable to climate change, with global vulnerability index ranging from −0.19 for Lontra longicaudis to −36,9 for Aonyx congicus. However, we found that, for a given species, climate change can have both positive and negative eﬀects on diﬀerent components of extrinsic exposure, and that measures of species' sensitivity are not necessarily congruent with measures of exposure. For instance, the range of all African species would be negatively aﬀected by climate change, but their diﬀerent sensitivity oﬀers a more (Hydrictis maculicollis, Aonyx capensis) or less (Aonyx congicus) pessimistic perspective on their ability to cope with climate change. Also, highly sensitive species like the {SouthAmerican} Pteronura brasiliensis, Lontra provocax, and Lutra perspicillata might face no exposure to climate change. For the Asian Lutra sumatrana, climate change would instead lead to an increased, less fragmented, and more protected range extent, but the range extent would also be shifted into areas with higher human disturbances. Our study represents a balanced example of how to develop an index aimed at comparatively evaluating vulnerability to climate change of diﬀerent species by combining diﬀerent aspects of sensitivity and exposure, providing additional information on which to base more eﬃcient conservation strategies.},

The challenge lies in simultaneously satisfying the connectivity needs of multiple species at multiple spatial scales under uncertain climate and land-use change. To evaluate the contribution of remnant habitat fragments to the connectivity of regional habitat networks, we developed a method to integrate uncertainty in climate and land-use change projections with the latest developments in network-connectivity research and spatial, multipurpose conservation prioritization. We used land-use change simulations to explore robustness of species’ habitat networks to alternative development scenarios. We applied our method to 14 vertebrate focal species of periurban Montreal, Canada. Accounting for connectivity in spatial prioritization strongly modified conservation priorities and the modified priorities were robust to uncertain climate change. Setting conservation priorities based on habitat quality and connectivity maintained a large proportion of the region’s connectivity, despite anticipated habitat loss due to climate and land-use change. The application of connectivity criteria alongside habitat-quality criteria for protected-area design was efficient with respect to the amount of area that needs protection and did not necessarily amplify trade-offs among conservation criteria. Our approach and results are being applied in and around Montreal and are well suited to the design of ecological networks and green infrastructure for the conservation of biodiversity and ecosystem services in other regions, in particular regions around large cities, where connectivity is critically low.},

Thus, there is an increasing interest in considering connectivity in landscape planning and habitat conservation. In this context, graph structures have been shown to be a powerful and eﬀective way of both representing the landscape pattern as a network and performing complex analysis regarding landscape connectivity. Many indices have been used for connectivity analyses so far but comparatively very little eﬀorts have been made to understand their behaviour and sensitivity to spatial changes, which seriously undermines their adequate interpretation and usefulness. We systematically compare a set of ten graph-based connectivity indices, evaluating their reaction to diﬀerent types of change that can occur in the landscape (habitat patches loss, corridors loss, etc.) and their eﬀectiveness for identifying which landscape elements are more critical for habitat conservation. Many of the available indices were found to present serious limitations that make them inadequate as a basis for conservation planning. We present a new index ({IIC}) that achieves all the properties of an ideal index according to our analysis. We suggest that the connectivity problem should be considered within the wider concept of habitat availability, which considers a habitat patch itself as a space where connectivity exists, integrating habitat amount and connectivity between habitat patches in a single measure.},

Using data on 288 Mediterranean ﬁsh species with varying conservation requirements, we show that: (1) considering both representation and connectivity objectives provides the best strategy for enhanced biodiversity persistence and (2) connectivity objectives were fundamental to enhancing persistence of small-ranged species, which are most in need of conservation, while the representation objective beneﬁted only wide-ranging species. Our approach provides a more comprehensive appraisal of planning applications than approaches focusing on either representation or connectivity, and will hopefully contribute to build more eﬀective reserve networks for the persistence of biodiversity.},

	abstract = {Background:  Phylogenetic diversity and evolutionary distinctiveness are highly valuable components of biodiversity, but they are rarely considered in conservation practices. Focusing on a biodiversity hotspot, the Mediterranean Basin, we aimed to identify those areas where evolutionary history is highly threatened and range-restricted in the region. Using null models, we first compared the spatial distributions of three indices: two measured threatened evolutionary history—Expected {PDloss} and Heightened Evolutionary distinctiveness and Global Endangerment—and one measured endemic evolutionary history—Biogeographically Evolutionary Distinctiveness. We focused on three vertebrate groups with high proportions of endemic, threatened species: amphibians, squamates and terrestrial mammals. Second, we estimated the spatial overlap of hotspots of threatened and endemic evolutionary history within the network of protected areas under several conservation scenarios.
Results:  Areas that concentrate evolutionary history of conservation interest greatly differed among taxa and indices, although a large proportion of hotspots were identified in the Maghreb, in the East of the Mediterranean Basin as well as in islands. We found that, in a minimum conservation scenario, there was a significant proportion of hotspots for amphibians and squamates that were protected but not for terrestrial mammals. However, in a strong conservation scenario, only few hotspots overlapped with protected areas and they were significantly less protected than in a model where hotspots were chosen randomly.
Conclusions:  Some sites concentrate highly threatened and range-restricted evolutionary history of the Mediterranean basin and their conservation could be much improved. These sites are relevant for conservation studies aimed at designing new conservation actions to preserve evolutionary history and the option values it represents.},

	abstract = {Lack of biodiversity data is a major impediment to prioritizing sites for species representation. Because comprehensive species data are not available in any planning area, planners often use surrogates (such as vegetation communities, or mapped occurrences of a well-­inventoried taxon) to prioritize sites. We propose and demonstrate the effectiveness of predicted rarity-­weighted richness ({PRWR}) as a surrogate in situations where species inventories may be available for a portion of the planning area. Use of {PRWR} as a surrogate involves several steps. First, rarity-­weighted richness ({RWR}) is calculated from species inventories for a q\% subset of sites. Then random forest models are used to model {RWR} as a function of freely available environmental variables for that q\% subset. This function is then used to calculate {PRWR} for all sites (including those for which no species inventories are available), and {PRWR} is used to prioritize all sites. We tested {PRWR} on plant and bird datasets, using the species accumulation index to measure efficiency of {PRWR}. Sites with the highest {PRWR} represented species with median efficiency of 56\% (range 32\%–77\% across six datasets) when q = 20\%, and with median efficiency of 39\% (range 20\%–63\%) when q = 10\%. An efficiency of 56\% means that selecting sites in order of {PRWR} rank was 56\% as effective as having full knowledge of species distributions in {PRWR}’s ability to improve on the number of species represented in the same number of randomly selected sites. Our results suggest that {PRWR} may be able to help prioritize sites to represent species if a planner has species inventories for 10\%–20\% of the sites in the planning area.},

Ecological niche modeling was used to determine distributions of 144 bird species across the province using a maximum entropy algorithm. Richness maps across all birds, and separately for rare and threatened species, were prepared as approximations to hotspots. Results showed close similarity between hotspots for all birds and those for rare birds; hotspots were concentrated in the southern and especially the southwestern parts of the province. Hotspots for threatened birds tended more to the central and especially the western parts of the province, which include coastal habitats. Based on three criteria, it is clear that the western part is the most important area of the province in terms of bird faunas. Despite some shortcomings, hotspot analysis could be applied to guide conservation efforts and provide useful tool towards efficient conservation action.},

	abstract = {Maintaining connectivity among remaining natural areas has become increasingly important to ameliorate the negative eﬀects of habitat loss and fragmentation on wildlife populations. Early corridor networks were based on structural connectivity (i.e. habitat structure) and designed to connect protected areas. In recent decades, many methods have been developed to increase the ecological realism of such corridor design to avoid misguided management. However, the multitude and complexity of methods can be a hurdle for conservation planners. Here, we combine a limited set of multiple methods to present a connectivity analysis framework that produces repeatable, intuitive, and ecologically relevant connectivity estimates. We use a modiﬁed habitat suitability analysis, accounting for protected area eﬀectiveness, as a starting point for least-cost corridor estimates, and evaluate the network using graph theory. We apply the framework to an existing corridor network in Belize, Central America, by estimating potential functional connectivity for white-lipped peccaries Tayassu pecari between systematically identiﬁed core patches. We found that forest productivity and protected area eﬀectiveness were important predictors of habitat suitability for white-lipped peccaries. The graph-theoretic network analyses identiﬁed particularly important core areas for overall landscape connectivity and indicated potentially weak links in the existing network, while the least-cost corridor outlines indicated general areas where the implementation of connectivity-enhancing measures could strengthen such weak links. With this study, we provide a framework to improve the scientiﬁc rigour, ecological meaningfulness, and conservation relevance of applied corridor network design.},

It is based on the following criteria: the habitat’s status, human population pressure, human efforts to protect habitat, and number of endemic plant and vertebrate species. We used this method to rank 25 hotspots, 17 megadiverse countries, and the hotspots within each megadiverse country. We used consistent, comprehensive, georeferenced, and multiband data sets and analytical remote sensing and geographic information system tools to quantify habitat status, human population pressure, and protection status. The ranking suggests that the Philippines, Atlantic Forest, Mediterranean Basin, Caribbean Islands, Caucasus, and Indo-Burma are the hottest hotspots and that China, the Philippines, and India are the hottest megadiverse countries. The great variation in terms of habitat, protected areas, and population pressure among the hotspots, the megadiverse countries, and the hotspots within the same country suggests the need for hotspot- and country-specific conservation policies.},

	abstract = {Rangelands are critical working landscapes and are the focus of considerable conservation planning efforts globally. A key conservation challenge in these landscapes is that high interannual variability in both climatic conditions and land use greatly limits the utility of outdated or static vegetation maps for management decision-making. One potential solution to this problem lies in remote sensing-derived information; however, prospective users must have continuous and timely access to vegetation products tailored to their needs. Google Earth Engine ({GEE}) can overcome the many storage, processing, and visualization barriers associated with creating ready-to-use remote sensing products for the public. While {GEE} provides a platform for building tools to analyze data and share results with users in near real-time for adaptive management, monitoring products need to (1) provide accurate and stable estimates over time and (2) align with management goals and the ecology of the rangeland system in question. Here, we assess estimates of vegetation cover and above-ground biomass at two dominant phenological time periods (summer/green and fall/brown), as modeled from the Landsat 7 and Landsat 8 Climatic Data Record ({CDR}) product. Using a best-subset regression modeling approach, we modeled vegetation cover and biomass, ﬁnding that the best predictors vary by season, corresponding to vegetation phenology. We also found that sensor-speciﬁc models decreased the relative differences between mapped cover and biomass estimates when comparing Landsat 7 and Landsat 8 scenes one day apart in the summer and fall. Ultimately, we developed an automated model selection process driven by sensor and vegetation greenness that can run in {GEE} to monitor and analyze vegetation amounts across the grazing season for adaptive management.},

Although prediction of risk is obviously a priority, such analyses are undermined by the fact that there may be non-linear and non-additive relationships between the species traits used. A Decision Tree analysis can accommodate with such relationships and here it is used to explore factors aﬀecting extinction risk in parrots. The results ﬁrstly verify that simple biological and biogeographical traits can separate threatened from non-threatened species. It is also possible to predict which species are likely to become threatened in the future. The utility of the method is not in testing evolutionary-based hypotheses to explain extinction risk, rather it is a simple and practical method of conﬁrming and/or predicting levels of risk. For well known taxonomic groups it could be used to conﬁrm current {IUCN} threat categories and identify which species should receive closest attention when the group is next reviewed. For poorly known groups it could be used to predict categories of threat for unclassiﬁed species from small groups of classiﬁed ones.},

	abstract = {{MAXENT} is now a common species distribution modeling ({SDM}) tool used by conservation practitioners for predicting the distribution of a species from a set of records and environmental predictors. However, datasets of species occurrence used to train the model are often biased in the geographical space because of unequal sampling effort across the study area. This bias may be a source of strong inaccuracy in the resulting model and could lead to incorrect predictions. Although a number of sampling bias correction methods have been proposed, there is no consensual guideline to account for it. We compared here the performance of five methods of bias correction on three datasets of species occurrence: one ‘‘virtual’’ derived from a land cover map, and two actual datasets for a turtle (Chrysemys picta) and a salamander (Plethodon cylindraceus). We subjected these datasets to four types of sampling biases corresponding to potential types of empirical biases. We applied five correction methods to the biased samples and compared the outputs of distribution models to unbiased datasets to assess the overall correction performance of each method. The results revealed that the ability of methods to correct the initial sampling bias varied greatly depending on bias type, bias intensity and species. However, the simple systematic sampling of records consistently ranked among the best performing across the range of conditions tested, whereas other methods performed more poorly in most cases. The strong effect of initial conditions on correction performance highlights the need for further research to develop a step-by-step guideline to account for sampling bias. However, this method seems to be the most efficient in correcting sampling bias and should be advised in most cases.},

	abstract = {In conservation prioritisation, it is often implicit that representation targets for individual habitat types act as surrogates for the species that inhabit them. Yet for many commercially and ecologically important coral reef fish species, connectivity among different habitats in a seascape may be more important than any single habitat alone. Approaches to conservation prioritisation that consider seascape connectivity are thus warranted. I demonstrate an approach that can be implemented within a relatively data-poor context, using widely available conservation planning software. Based on clearly stated assumptions regarding species’ habitat usage and movement ability, this approach can be adapted to different focal species and contexts, or refined as further data become available. I first derive a seascape connectivity metric based on area-weighted proximity between juvenile and adult habitat patches, and then apply this during spatial prioritisation using the decision-support software Marxan. Using a case study from Micronesia, I present two applications: first, to inform prioritisation for a network of marine protected areas to achieve regional objectives for habitat representation; and second, to identify nursery habitat patches that are most likely to supply juveniles to adult populations on reefs within existing protected areas. Incorporating seascape connectivity in conservation prioritisation highlights areas where small marine protected areas placed on coral reefs might benefit from proximity to other habitats in the seascape, and thus be more effective. Within the context of community tenure over resources, identification of critical nursery habitats to improve the effectiveness of existing marine protected areas indicates where collaboration across community boundaries might be required. Outputs from these analyses are likely to be most useful in regions where management is highly decentralised, imposing spatial constraints on the size of individual protected areas.},

Sustainable land use approaches for nature conservation are urgently needed to effectively counter these trends. This research develops and tests a methodological approach to assess the biodiversity potential of landscapes in city regions to provide the necessary information for this purpose. Landscape character assessment, an approach developed in the {UK}, is adapted and tested in Kwangju, a fast growing city region in the South west of the Korean peninsula. Twelve landscape character types are distinguished and landscape metrics (landscape heterogeneity, patch shape, patch context and patch distance) are customised to provide quantitative information on their biodiversity potential. Only land cover data that could be obtained from existing topographical maps and aerial photographs is required for this approach. It is suggested that the methodology presented in this paper can provide the necessary information to support sustainable land use planning for nature conservation in Korean city regions and elsewhere.},

Potential indicator species were extracted by indicator species analysis ({INSPAN}) and compared with the results of single-trait and multitrait {PFG} approaches, which classify plant species into groups based on individual or combinations of traits (growth form, life span, dispersal mode, ﬂowering season and plant height).
Results: Only the multi-trait {PFG} approach successfully clustered the vegetation plots for each management type. Semi-natural burned-and-grazed grasslands in the eastern and northern regions were characterized by a speciﬁc {PFG} among 21 {PFGs}, whereas the same three {PFGs} characterized the burned-and-mowed seminatural grassland of the two regions. The extracted {PFGs} represent combinations of vegetative, dispersal and reproductive traits (e.g. short, wind- and animal-dispersed species for grazed semi-natural grasslands; tall, summer-ﬂowering forbs for mowed semi-natural grasslands). As compared to indicator species extracted by the multi-trait {PFG} approach, {INSPAN} extracted additional indicator species, but some of these were inappropriate.
Conclusions: We identiﬁed {PFGs} representing each management type and characterized species adaptations to different disturbance regimes, such as mowing and grazing. Among the species extracted by {INSPAN}, only those classiﬁed into the representative {PFGs} can serve as indicators for characterizing managed semi-natural grasslands. Our ﬁndings indicate that using a multi-trait {PFG} approach can provide reasonable plant indicators for monitoring grassland communities throughout the regions when combined with a speciesbased {INSPAN} approach. This proposed method would contribute to the conservation of plant biodiversity in threatened semi-natural grazed and mowed grasslands.},

We compared our conservation plan for three target bird species from a highland farm with the conservation plan produced using Marxan alone. Our comparison showed the effectiveness of our approach by selecting a reserve network with higher habitat suitability, better connection, and smaller size after relatively minor landscape modiﬁcation. The proposed approach advances previous reserve site selection algorithms by considering optimal landscape conﬁguration and potential species distributions for a reserve network design. Our approach yields priority maps to guide the design of a reserve network as well as identify landscape management for conservation.},

We used an ordinal analytical approach to model relationships between species-level traits and extinction risk categories. We found that larger species and those with shallower maximum depths and smaller geographic ranges had higher extinction risk. Using our best ﬁtting model, we classiﬁed data deﬁcient grouper species into {IUCN}’s extinction risk categories based on traits. Most of these species were predicted to be of least concern.

	abstract = {Effective monitoring of biodiversity for conservation requires information on spatial and temporal variation in species’ abundances. As conservation resources are limited, monitoring methods are required that enable rapid and cost effective data collection. There are many traditional methods of estimating absolute abundance, such as territory mapping and distance sampling. However, these typically require more time, expertise and ﬁnances than are available across much of the globe. This is especially so in the tropics, where high species richness, low densities of many species and structurally complex environments also make monitoring particularly challenging. The {MacKinnon} lists technique is a rapid assessment methodology designed for use in species rich environments. This method is typically used to estimate species richness, but it has also been suggested that it can generate consistent abundance indices, even when observer experience and environmental conditions vary. If this suggestion is correct, the {MacKinnon} lists method could be used to assess spatial or temporal changes in abundance using diverse survey data. Here, we provide the ﬁrst detailed assessment of intra- and inter-observer consistency of the Mackinnon List method in generating species abundance indices that could be useful for conservation monitoring purposes. As a case study, we use one of the world’s most diverse avifaunas, that of the forested Bolivian Andes. We show that {MacKinnon} lists can provide species abundance indices that are consistent between observers of markedly different experience of the focal avifauna (zero to six years), and between assessments carried out in different stages of the breeding season, between which detectability of individuals differed signiﬁcantly. We believe this is the ﬁrst time that a biodiversity monitoring method has been demonstrated to produce consistent abundance indices for a highly diverse avian tropical assemblage. We also suggest that the {MacKinnon} lists methodology has the potential to be a very useful conservation monitoring tool for many taxa in species rich environments, such as the tropics.},

	abstract = {The geographical area occupied by a species is a valuable measure for assessing its conservation status. Coarse-grained occupancy maps are available for many taxa, e.g., as atlases, but often at spatial resolutions too coarse for conservation use. However, mapping occupancy at ﬁne spatial resolution across the entire extent of the species’ distribution is often prohibitively expensive for the majority of species. Occupancy downscaling is a technique to estimate ﬁner scale occupancy from coarse scale maps, by using the occupancyarea relationship ({OAR}) which reﬂects how the proportion of area occupied increases with spatial grain size. Models that describe the {OAR} are ﬁtted to observed occupancies at the available coarse-grain sizes and then extrapolated to predict occupancy at the ﬁner grain sizes required. The downscale package in the R programming environment provides users with easy-to-use functions for downscaling occupancy with ten published models. First, upgrain calculates occupancy for multiple grain sizes larger than the input data. Normal methods for aggregating raster data increase the extent of the focal area as grain size increases which is undesirable, so the function ﬁxes the extent for all grain sizes, assigning unsampled cells as absences. Four suggested methods are provided to enable this and upgrain.threshold provides diagnostic plots that allow the user to explore the inherent trade-oﬀ between making assumptions about unsampled locations and discarding information from sampled locations. downscale ﬁts nine possible models to the data generated from upgrain. hui.downscale ﬁts the special case of the Hui model. predict and plot extrapolate the ﬁtted models to predict and plot occupancy at ﬁner grain sizes. Finally, ensemble.downscale simultaneously ﬁts two or more of the downscaling models and calculates mean predicted occupancy across all selected models. Here we describe the package and apply the functions to atlas data of a hypothetical {UK} species.},

Innovative spatio-temporal modelling tools may be valuable to support the design and optimization of conservation strategies for endangered species in a context of changes in land use and land cover ({LULC}). The Red-billed Chough (Pyrrhocorax pyrrhocorax) is a vulnerable corvid that exhibits high levels of population fragmentation and decline trends, due to its dependence on open habitats shaped by traditional agriculture and pastoralism. Here, we apply a spatially-explicit framework based on the stochastic dynamic methodology ({StDM}) principles to capture the trends of relevant population foraging ground attributes, assumed as proxies of the habitat suitability for two endangered Portuguese chough populations. {StDM} simulations were produced in order to capture the densities and distribution patterns of foraging ﬂocking choughs in response to the complexity and dynamics of some realistic abandonment {LULC} scenarios expected to occur in the near future. Our modelling outputs reﬂect satisfactorily the seasonality of these patterns and suggest that the maintenance of traditional agriculture/pastoralism practices in at least 75\% of the actual favourable areas is mandatory to ensure the foraging habitat suitability for choughs, evidencing the species high vulnerability in their last refuges in Portugal. This modelling approach represents a step forward in evaluating the consequences of {LULC} changes on endangered birds, which can be used in the future to guide eﬀective conservation planning in the scope of habitat suitability management.},

The Canada Species at Risk Act (2002) lists species that are threatened with regional extinction, and roads have been identified as a significant threat for many of these wildlife species in Ontario, e.g. turtles. In response to negative road impacts on wildlife, we developed a {GIS} modeling tool that predicts high-risk road mortality locations for selected wetland-forest herpetofaunal species that are representative of the landscape. We obtained a habitat suitability index (sum of weighted habitat scores) within a 12.6 hectare buffer surrounding each 15 x 15 m pixel of road in the landscape. Validation of the final model with dead and alive on-road herpetofaunal data showed animals were more at risk of road mortality when roads bisected large areas of wetland-forest habitat. The tool has been effective to promote proactive mitigation planning within government transportation agencies at the municipal and provincial level. Future work will develop species-specific models that identify road mortality locations along roads that re-connect habitat from a local and metapopulation perspective. In addition, the models will be used to prioritize locations along roads for effective mitigation solutions, e.g. turtle crossing signs and wildlife crossing structures.},

Numerous methods have been developed to evaluate the importance of species based on their contribution to total phylogenetic diversity on trees and networks, but existing methods fail to take complementarity into account, and thus cannot identify the best order or subset of taxa to protect. Here, we develop a novel iterative calculation of the heightened evolutionary distinctiveness and globally endangered metric (I-{HEDGE}) that produces the optimal ranked list for conservation prioritization, taking into account complementarity and based on both phylogenetic diversity and extinction probability. We applied this metric to a phylogenetic network based on mitochondrial control region data from extant and recently extinct giant Galápagos tortoises, a highly endangered group of closely related species. We found that the restoration of two extinct species (a project currently underway) will contribute the greatest gain in phylogenetic diversity, and present an ordered list of rankings that is the optimum complementarity set for conservation prioritization.},

	shorttitle = {Designing ecological corridors in a fragmented landscape},
	abstract = {Landscape connectivity analysis is a major tool in supporting biodiversity conservation. Several methodologies have been developed to tackle it by following two main paths. The ﬁrst path exploits graph approaches and models focal nodes’ connections on a resistance/conductance matrix depending on focal species’ movement potential. The second path considers geometrical pattern analyses based on the calculation of structural landscape metrics. These approaches separately investigate functional and structural features of the landscape, and may come short of a total deﬁnition if used separately. Here we propose a new scalable, modular, participative and open-source procedure based on Fuzzy logic to combine the functional and structural aspects of connectivity. We applied this method on the highly fragmented landscape of the Po Plain, focusing on its rare and endangered plain springs named fontanili. We identiﬁed an expert panel and involved it in the assignation of permeability values of land use classes with respect to the capacity of movement of animal species typical of fontanili. We concurrently performed a quantitative evaluation of the landscape fragmentation with a moving window. We found that the functional and structural evaluations were poorly correlated in the area under study (Pearson’s r = −0.35, p {\textless} 0.001). We thus integrated these two non-overlapping analyses of the landscape by Fuzzy logic using thresholds and combination weights obtained from questionnaires proposed to the expert panel. The resulting index, termed Fuzzy Functionality Index ({FFI}), improved the level of information associated with landscape classiﬁcation. By merging functional and structural aspects of the landscape, the {FFI} allowed us to discriminate different functional values of equally permeable parcels and vice versa. We demonstrate that {FFI} may act as a conductance measure in a circuit theory approach, highlighting ecological corridors between focal points of species’ distribution. We present {FFI} as an effective predictive index to inspect complex and non-linear landscape dynamics.},

Range maps used to assess threat status often contain large areas of unsuitable habitat, thereby overestimating range and underestimating threat. In this study, we assessed 18 endemic birds of the Western Ghats biodiversity hotspot to test the accuracy of the geographic range sizes used by the {IUCN} for their threat assessment. Using independently reviewed data from the world's largest citizen science database ({eBird}) within a species distribution modeling framework, our results show that: (a) geographic ranges have been vastly overestimated by {IUCN} for 17 of the 18 endemic bird species; (b) range maps used by {IUCN} contain large areas of unsuitable habitat, and (c) ranges estimated in this study suggest provisional uplisting of {IUCN} threat status for at least 10 of the 18 species based on area metrics used by the {IUCN} for threat assessment. Since global range size is an important parameter for assigning {IUCN} threat status, citizen science datasets, high resolution and freely available geo-referenced ecological data, and the latest species distribution modeling techniques should be used to estimate and track changes in range extent whenever possible. The methods used here to signiﬁcantly revise range estimates have important conservation management implications not only for endemic birds in the Western Ghats, but for vertebrate and invertebrate taxa worldwide.},

	abstract = {The worldwide decline of coral reefs threatens the livelihoods of coastal communities and puts at risk valuable ecosystem services provided by reefs. There is a pressing need for robust predictions of potential futures of coral reef and associated human systems under alternative management scenarios. Understanding and predicting the dynamics of coral reef systems at regional scales of tens to hundreds of kilometers is imperative, because reef systems are connected by physical and socioeconomic processes across regions and often across international boundaries. We present a spatially explicit regional-scale model of ecological dynamics for a general coral reef system. In designing our model as a tool for decision support, we gave precedence to portability and accessibility; the model can be parameterized for dissimilar coral reef systems in different parts of the world, and the model components and outputs are understandable for nonexperts. The model simulates local-scale dynamics, which are coupled across regions through larval connectivity between reefs. We validate our model using an instantiation for the Meso-American Reef system. The model realistically captures local and regional ecological dynamics and responds to external forcings in the form of harvesting, pollution, and physical damage (e.g., hurricanes, coral bleaching) to produce trajectories that largely fall within limits observed in the real system. Moreover, the model demonstrates behaviors that have relevance for management considerations. In particular, differences in larval supply between reef localities drive spatial variability in modeled reef community structure. Reef tracts for which recruitment is low are more vulnerable to natural disturbance and synergistic effects of anthropogenic stressors. Our approach provides a framework for projecting the likelihood of different reef futures at local to regional scales, with important applications for the management of complex coral reef systems.},

	abstract = {An important task in conservation biology is to assess the spatial scale pertinent for species protection since some species may require protection throughout their distribution, others in only part of their range. Once this is done, species can be correctly identiﬁed for listing at different administrative levels (e.g. continental, national, and local). Here, we propose an objective method to list taxa at nested administrative levels based on three criteria (responsibility, rarity and vulnerability). We tested the method using quantitative data on the distribution, abundance and decline of orchids in France. The proposed method enables increased protection status in regions where species’ abundance and diversity are higher, gives priority to species for which an individual administrative unit has high responsibility and allows objective integration of species decline at different administrative levels. The method also enables the integration of locally rare species at their distribution limits and avoids repetition of species listing across second-level administrative units. The use of an objective method such as this could contribute to a standardised system of priority setting that integrates the geographic scale of rarity in relation to different administrative levels for protection.},

Here, we propose a multi-objective solution for {SCP}, increasing its ﬂexibility and complexity, and, at the same time, augmenting the quality of provided information, which reinforces decision-making. We used ensemble forecasting, considering future climate simulations to estimate species occurrence projected to 2080. Our method identiﬁes sites: 1) of high priority for conservation; 2) with signiﬁcant risk of investment; and, 3) that may become attractive in the future. To the best of our knowledge, this application to a real-world problem in ecology is the ﬁrst attempt to apply multi-objective optimization to {SCP} associated to climate forecasting, in a dynamic spatial prioritization analysis for biodiversity conservation.},

In this study, the distribution of protected areas in Victoria, Australia is assessed in relation to environmental space. We use comprehensiveness, adequacy and representativeness ({CAR}) criteria as a framework to examine the efﬁciency of existing protected areas and to deﬁne gaps in the current reserve system, based on multivariate environmental space.

Our framework provides feasible tools for involving {CAR} principles in evaluating the efﬁciency of reserve areas. Our metrics are transparent, simple to interpret and easy to implement.

Measuring connectivity is challenging, resulting in a limited understanding of the efﬁcacy of connectivity estimation techniques and the conditions under which they perform best. We evaluated the performance of four commonly used connectivity metrics – Euclidean distance; least-cost paths ({LCP}) length and cost; and circuit theory’s resistance distance – over a variety of simulated landscapes. We developed an agent-based model simulating the dispersal of individuals with different behavioural traits across landscapes varying in their spatial structure. The outcomes of multiple dispersal attempts were used to obtain ‘true’ connectivity. These ‘true’ connectivity measures were then compared to estimates generated using the connectivity metrics, employing the simulated landscapes as cost-surfaces. The four metrics differed in the strength of their correlation with true connectivity; resistance distance showed the strongest correlation, closely followed by {LCP} cost, with Euclidean distance having the weakest. Landscape structure and species behavioural attributes only weakly predicted the performance of resistance distance, {LCP} cost and length estimates, with none predicting Euclidean distance’s efﬁcacy. Our results indicate that resistance distance and {LCP} cost produce the most accurate connectivity estimates, although their absolute performance under different conditions is difﬁcult to predict. We emphasise the importance of testing connectivity estimates against patterns derived from independent data, such as those acquired from tracking studies. Our ﬁndings should help to inform a more reﬁned implementation of connectivity metrics in conservation management.},

We developed a single-nucleotide polymorphism ({SNP}) panel to identify Gilbert Bay cod in areas outside {MPA} boundaries where mixing with offshore cod occurs.

Estimates of effective population size for the Gilbert Bay population ranged from 655 to 1114.

	abstract = {In conservation biology genetic diversity is recognized as an important criterion to consider when prioritizing populations for protection. Today, population genomics offers the opportunity to evaluate both neutral and adaptive components of genetic diversity directly at the genome level with molecular tools. By screening the genome with many genetic markers, it is possible to detect loci supposedly under natural selection and thus of adaptive significance. We devised a new diversity index, the population adaptive index ({PAI}), which accounts for the adaptive value of the population it refers to. To estimate this index, we performed a genome scan with amplified fragment length polymorphism markers to identify neutral and selected loci in several populations of a widespread amphibian (common frog, Rana temporaria) and a threatened plant (Austrian dragonhead, Dracocephalum austriacum L.). We then investigated four different conservation strategies aimed at protecting the maximum amount of genetic diversity (neutral or selected). In particular we explored the relevance of the principle of complementarity, usually applied to the protection of species, in the management of intraspecific diversity. This principle advocates the conservation of sets of units that together maximize the species’ or genetic diversity, which is in opposition to the traditional approach of targeting populations that are the most diverse individually. Four major conclusions emerged from these results. First, the {PAI} seemed to be a valuable index to evaluate the adaptive diversities within populations. Second, in the two species, the neutral and adaptive diversities within and among populations were not correlated, so conservation strategies based on the neutral and adaptive indexes would not select the same populations for protection. Third, because of its efficiency in conserving genetic diversity, the principle of complementarity deserves to be used more often for this purpose. Fourth, when neutral and adaptive results conflict, additional arguments (e.g., demography, ecology, and geographic proximity) should be considered together with levels of genetic diversity to determine a conservation strategy.},

	abstract = {Because of its role in many ecological processes, movement of animals in response to landscape features is an important subject in ecology and conservation biology. In this paper, we develop models of animal movement in relation to objects or ﬁelds in a landscape. We took a ﬁnite mixture modeling approach in which the component densities are conceptually related to different choices for movement in response to a landscape feature, and the mixing proportions are related to the probability of selecting each response as a function of one or more covariates. We combined particle swarm optimization and an expectationmaximization ({EM}) algorithm to obtain maximum-likelihood estimates of the model parameters. We used this approach to analyze data for movement of three bobcats in relation to urban areas in southern California, {USA}. A behavioral interpretation of the models revealed similarities and differences in bobcat movement response to urbanization. All three bobcats avoided urbanization by moving either parallel to urban boundaries or toward less urban areas as the proportion of urban land cover in the surrounding area increased. However, one bobcat, a male with a dispersal-like large-scale movement pattern, avoided urbanization at lower densities and responded strictly by moving parallel to the urban edge. The other two bobcats, which were both residents and occupied similar geographic areas, avoided urban areas using a combination of movements parallel to the urban edge and movement toward areas of less urbanization. However, the resident female appeared to exhibit greater repulsion at lower levels of urbanization than the resident male, consistent with empirical observations of bobcats in southern California. Using the parameterized ﬁnite mixture models, we mapped behavioral states to geographic space, creating a representation of a behavioral landscape. This approach can provide guidance for conservation planning based on analysis of animal movement data using statistical models, thereby linking connectivity evaluations to empirical data.},

Usually, the more the landscape is complex the more the biodiversity increases. Biodiversity indicators can be a useful tool to assess biodiversity status, in function of landscape heterogeneity. In this study, we developed a biodiversity indicator, based on Shannon diversity index and built from distribution maps of protected species. With such an approach, we seek to evaluate the feasibility of using a combination of target species as a surrogate for assessing the status of the whole bird community. Our approach was spread over multiple spatial scales, to determine which was the most informative. We selected four species protected by European regulation and generated a presence-absence map from species distribution modelling. We, therefore, used the {FRAGSTATS} biodiversity metric to calculate Shannon index for the overlapped presence-absence maps, at two spatial scales (500 m and 1000 m). Then, the relationships with the whole community was assessed through generalised least square models, at the spatial scale of 4 ha, 9 ha and 25 ha. Results showed that the higher rate of variability of community was explained by the biodiversity indicator at 1000 m scale. Indeed, the more informative spatial scale for the whole bird community was 9 ha. In addition, a pattern emerged about the relationships between biodiversity indicator and community richness, that is worth of further research. Our study demonstrates that the usefulness of surrogate species for biodiversity and community assessment can become clear only at a certain spatial scales. Indeed, they can be highly predictive of the whole community, and highly informative for conservation planning. Moreover, their use can optimize biodiversity monitoring and conservation, focusing on a small number of noteworthy species.},

Species specialists validated the generated distribution maps through an online Google Earth interface with the scores from Invalid to Excellent. Experts were also asked about the commission and omission errors of the distribution models they evaluated. We weighted expert scores according to consensus theory. These values were used to obtain a ﬁnal average expert score for each of the produced distribution models. The consensus-weighted expert scores were compared with un-weighted scores and correlated to four conventional model performance parameters after cross-validation with test data: Area Under Curve ({AUC}), maximum Kappa, commission error and omission error.
Results: The median consensus-weighted expert score of all species–variable combinations was close to Fair. In general, experts that reached more consensus with peers were more positive about the {EEM} outcomes, compared to those that had more opposite judgements. Both consensus-weighted and un-weighted scores were signiﬁcantly correlated to corresponding {AUC}, maximum Kappa and commission error values, but not to omission errors. More than half of the experts indicated that the distribution model they considered best included areas where the species is known to be absent. One third also indicated areas of species presence that were omitted by the model.
Conclusions: Our results indicate that experts are fairly positive about {EEM} outcomes. This is encouraging, but {EEM} application for conservation actions remains limited according to them. Methods to formalize expert knowledge allow a wider use of this information in model validation and improvement, and they complement conventional validation methods of presence-only modelling.

	abstract = {Systematic conservation planning aims to design networks of protected areas that meet conservation goals across large landscapes. The optimal design of these conservation networks is most frequently based on the modeled habitat suitability or probability of occurrence of species, despite evidence that model predictions may not be highly correlated with species density. We hypothesized that conservation networks designed using species density distributions more efficiently conserve populations of all species considered than networks designed using probability of occurrence models. To test this hypothesis, we used the Zonation conservation prioritization algorithm to evaluate conservation network designs based on probability of occurrence versus density models for 26 land bird species in the U.S. Pacific Northwest. We assessed the efficacy of each conservation network based on predicted species densities and predicted species diversity. High-density model Zonation rankings protected more individuals per species when networks protected the highest priority 10-40\% of the landscape. Compared with density-based models, the occurrence-based models protected more individuals in the lowest 50\% priority areas of the landscape. The 2 approaches conserved species diversity in similar ways: predicted diversity was higher in higher priority locations in both conservation networks. We conclude that both density and probability of occurrence models can be useful for setting conservation priorities but that density-based models are best suited for identifying the highest priority areas. Developing methods to aggregate species count data from unrelated monitoring efforts and making these data widely available through ecoinformatics portals such as the Avian Knowledge Network will enable species count data to be more widely incorporated into systematic conservation planning efforts.},

	abstract = {In the face of inevitable future losses to biodiversity, ranking species by conservation priority seems more than prudent. Setting conservation priorities within species (i.e., at the population level) may be critical as species ranges become fragmented and connectivity declines. However, existing approaches to prioritization (e.g., scoring organisms by their expected genetic contribution) are based on phylogenetic trees, which may be poor representations of differentiation below the species level. In this paper we extend evolutionary isolation indices used in conservation planning from phylogenetic trees to phylogenetic networks. Such networks better represent population differentiation, and our extension allows populations to be ranked in order of their expected contribution to the set. We illustrate the approach using data from two imperiled species: the spotted owl Strix occidentalis in North America and the mountain pygmy-possum Burramys parvus in Australia. Using previously published mitochondrial and microsatellite data, we construct phylogenetic networks and score each population by its relative genetic distinctiveness. In both cases, our phylogenetic networks capture the geographic structure of each species: geographically peripheral populations harbor less-redundant genetic information, increasing their conservation rankings. We note that our approach can be used with all conservation-relevant distances (e.g., those based on whole-genome, ecological, or adaptive variation) and suggest it be added to the assortment of tools available to wildlife managers for allocating effort among threatened populations.},

	abstract = {Odonata are valuable biological indicators of freshwater ecosystem integrity and climate change, and the northeastern {USA} (Virginia to Maine) is a hotspot of odonate diversity and a region of historical and growing threats to freshwater ecosystems. This duality highlights the urgency of developing a comprehensive conservation assessment of the region’s 228 resident odonate species. We oﬀer a prioritization framework modiﬁed from {NatureServe}’s method for assessing conservation status ranks by assigning a single regional vulnerability metric (R-rank) reﬂecting each species’ degree of relative extinction risk in the northeastern {USA}. We calculated the R-rank based on 3 rarity factors (range extent, area of occupancy, and habitat speciﬁcity), 1 threat factor (vulnerability of occupied habitats), and 1 trend factor (relative change in range size). We combine this R-rank with the degree of endemicity (\% of the species’ {USA} and Canadian range that falls within the region) as a proxy for regional responsibility, thereby deriving a list of species of combined vulnerability and regional management responsibility. Overall, 18\% of the region’s odonate fauna is imperiled (R1 and R2), and peatlands, low-gradient streams and seeps, high-gradient headwaters, and larger rivers that harbor a disproportionate number of these species should be considered as priority habitat types for conservation. We anticipate that our analysis might serve as a model for guiding and standardizing conservation assessments at multiple scales for Odonata and other diverse taxa that have not yet received attention to prioritization.},

	abstract = {Genetic diversity is necessary for evolutionary response to changing environmental conditions such as those facing many threatened and endangered species. To investigate the relationship between genetic diversity and conservation status, we conducted a systematic, quantitative review of vertebrate microsatellite data published since 1990: we screened 5165 previously published articles and identiﬁed 1941 microsatellite datasets spanning 17,988 loci that characterized wild populations distributed among ﬁve vertebrate classes. We analyzed these data in the context of conservation by comparing empirical estimates of heterozygosity and allelic richness between threatened and non-threatened species. We found that both heterozygosity and allelic richness are reduced in threatened species, suggesting that inbreeding and drift are both effective at removing genetic diversity in endangered populations. We then considered the criteria typically used to rank species of conservation concern (including declining population size, species range extent, and the number of mature individuals) to determine which of these criteria are most effective at identifying genetically depauperate species. However, we found that the existing criteria failed to systematically identify populations with low genetic diversity. To rectify this, we suggest a novel approach for identifying species of conservation need by estimating the expected loss of genetic diversity. We then evaluated the efﬁcacy of our new approach and found that it performs signiﬁcantly better than the existing methods for identifying species that merit conservation concern in part because of reduced genetic diversity.},

So far, airborne laser scanning system ({ALS} or airborne {LiDAR}) has shown promising results in tree cover mapping for urban areas. This paper analyzes the potential of mobile laser scanning system/mobile mapping system ({MLS}/{MMS})-based methods for recognition of urban plant species and characterization of growth conditions using ultra-dense {LiDAR} point clouds and provides an objective comparison with the {ALS}-based methods. Firstly, to solve the extremely intensive computational burden caused by the classiﬁcation of ultra-dense {MLS} data, a new method for the semantic labeling of {LiDAR} data in the urban road environment is developed based on combining a conditional random ﬁeld ({CRF}) for the context-based classiﬁcation of 3D point clouds with shape priors. These priors encode geometric primitives found in the scene through sample consensus segmentation. Then, single trees are segmented from the labelled tree points using the 3D graph cuts algorithm. Multinomial logistic regression classiﬁers are used to determine the ﬁne deciduous urban tree species of conversation concern and their growth vitality. Finally, the weight-of-evidence ({WofE}) based decision fusion method is applied to combine the probability outputs of classiﬁcation results from the {MLS} and {ALS} data. The experiment results obtained in city road corridors demonstrated that point cloud data acquired from the airborne platform achieved even slightly better results in terms of tree detection rate, tree species and vitality classiﬁcation accuracy, although the tree vitality distribution in the test site is less balanced compared to the species distribution. When combined with {MLS} data, overall accuracies of 78\% and 74\% for tree species and vitality classiﬁcation can be achieved, which has improved by 5.7\% and 4.64\% respectively compared to the usage of airborne data only.},

It is found that forest made the greatest contribution and the significant increasing area of wetland has huge potential benefit for environmental conservation in Taiwan.

To address the gap, we integrated systematic conservation planning ({SCP}) with gap analysis to optimize solutions of protected areas planning at local scales. In this study, we presented a quantitative spatial methodology for prioritization and downscaled to a planning case study in the province of Shanxi, China. First, the spatial distribution of 54 threatened plant species were mapped at ﬁne resolution, and scenarios of conservation targets for taxa were generated according to species attributes, which are both the necessary inputs in selection algorithm of priority conservation. Then we determined 17 priority conservation areas using {SCP}, which only cover ∼5\% of the total area but could represent 100\% of the threatened plant species in Shanxi Province. We conﬁrmed that priority conservation areas determined based on {SCP} can achieve maximum efﬁciency of conservation, especially considering representation of small-ranged species. Further, through overlapping priority conservation areas with nature reserves, six conservation gaps were identiﬁed for future conservation efforts. Our ﬁndings provide suggestions for protected areas network planning of botanical conservation in real-world contexts. The proposed method of integrating {SCP} with gap analysis can be generally used in bridging the gap between biodiversity priority areas and protected areas in proactive planning and management protocol for biodiversity conservation.},

	abstract = {Observed species richness ({OSR}) is a widely used and well-studied biodiversity metric. However, non-observed species in favorable ecosystems are also relevant. Two metrics that include observed and potential species were recently deﬁned: potential biodiversity (hereafter potential species richness—{PSR}) and geometric mean of favorabilities ({GMF}). We used these metrics to evaluate the national park network of mainland Spain at two time periods (2002 and 2015), using terrestrial mammals on a {UTM} 100-km2 grid. {PSR} and {GMF} are based on the favorability function, a species distribution model that assesses how favorable an area is for the presence of a species, over and above its prevalence in the study area. For each park and for the whole network, we calculated the mean and sum of {OSR}, {PSR}, and {GMF} in each time period, as well as changes between periods. {OSR} and {PSR} were higher inside than outside the park network in both time periods. Thus, although the network covers a very small proportion of the country, it performs well for the representation of mammal species and their favorable areas. However, mean {PSR} was lower in 2015 than in 2002 inside the national park network, whereas the opposite was the case outside the network. Mountainous Parks generally not only concentrated highly favorable areas for mammals, but they also showed less favorable areas in 2015 compared to 2002, although the reduction was moderate to low. This is a result to consider for future analyses because if the tendency increases, it may have consequences for the conservation of mammals and for the adequacy of the national park network.},

	abstract = {The main goal of using global biodiversity hotspots for conservation purposes is to protect taxa with small geographic ranges because these are highly vulnerable to extinction. However, the extent to what different hotspots types are effective for meeting this goal remains controversial because hotspots have been previously deﬁned as either the richest or most threatened and richest sites in terms of total, endemic or threatened species. In this regard, the use of species richness to set conservation priorities is widely discussed because strategies focused on this diversity measure tend to miss many of the taxa with small geographic ranges. Here we use data on global terrestrial mammal distributions to show that, hotspots of total species, endemism and threat deﬁned in terms of species richness are effective in including 27\%, 29\% and 11\% respectively, of the taxa with small geographic ranges. Whilst, the same hotspot types deﬁned in terms of a simple diversity index, which is a function of species richness and range-size rarity, include 68\%, 44\% and 90\% respectively, of these taxa. In addition, we demonstrate that index hotspot types are highly efﬁcient because they conserve 79\% of mammal species (21\% more species than richness hotspot types), with 59\% of species shared by three hotspot types (31\% more than richness hotspot types). These results suggest that selection of different diversity measures to deﬁne hotspots may strongly affect the achievement of conservation goals.},

We also derived a novel measure of mammal conservation importance for each site based on a ‘‘Mammalian Conservation Priority index” ({MPi}) which incorporates information on species richness, population abundance, body size distribution, conservation status, and forest patch area. Mammal abundance was affected by hunting pressure, whereas mammalian biomass of which was largely driven by ungulates, was signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced by both forest type and hunting pressure. The {MPi} index, when separated into its two main components (i.e. site forest area and species-based conservation index Ci), ordered sites along a gradient of management priorities that balances species-focused and habitatfocused conservation actions. Areas with the highest conservation priority were located in semi-deciduous forest fragments, followed by lowland forests. Many of these fragments, which are often embedded within large private landholdings including biofuel and citrus or coffee crops, cattle ranches and pulpwood plantations, could be used not only to comply with environmental legislation, but also enhance the prospects for biodiversity conservation, and reduce edge effects and hunting.},

In this study, we identiﬁed hotspots at two scales of analysis within the Mediterranean overall hotspot. Particularly, based on the distribution of endemic-vascular-plant richness ({EVPR}), we identiﬁed microhotspots, among the richest ﬂoristic territories of the Sardinian and Baetic regions, and nano-hotspots, among the richest 1-km2 grid cells of Sierra Nevada and Gennargentu massifs, located within these regions. In addition, we explored environmental drivers of {EVPR}, performing both simple- and multiple-regression models. Our results showed that even in areas previously deﬁned as hotspots, the endemic-plant richness was not uniformly distributed, but rather depended largely on environmental conditions. Relationships between environmental drivers and {EVPR} have been poorly studied in the Mediterranean context, where we found patterns consistent among scales and regions. Speciﬁcally, {EVPR} was positively linked to altitude and precipitation, particularly in the driest period. Hence, the different levels of hotspots nested in hotspots were organized in a hierarchy. This downscaling approach may help to focus conservation efforts within a given hotspot, e.g. the identiﬁcation of narrow hotspots could be useful to ﬁnd gaps in the protected-area networks. Speciﬁcally, the identiﬁed nano-hotspots are certainly priority sites for plant conservation, since the whole of the nano-hotspots in each region represented less than 1\% of the surface area but contained more than 19\% of the regional {EVPR}. Moreover, an examination of both where hotspots are and under what environmental conditions they appear, would enable the detection of speciﬁc threats.},

	abstract = {The Red List can be used a gauging tool by conservationists to assess which species require focused conservation attention. Mapping the relative distributions of species, and identiﬁcation of centers of richness, endemism and threat are a ﬁrst step towards site-oriented conservation action. We use here a specially developed biodiversity index, based on three weighted sub-components assigned to each species: geographical distribution, Red List status, and sensitivity to habitat change. We test this approach using what is called here the Dragonﬂy Biotic Index ({DBI}) to prioritize sites for conservation action, with special emphasis on species occurrence in three global hotspots in southern Africa. Using a selected set of the 23 top prioritized sites, we compare the {DBI}’s performance to that of a rarity–complementarity algorithm. As with several other taxa, local endemism levels are highest in the Cape Floristic Region ({CFR}), while richness is highest in the north east, particularly in the stream systems of the Maputaland–Pondoland–Albany ({MPA}) hotspot. Red Listed Odonata species are also concentrated in the {CFR}, while richness is highest in the {MPA} hotspot. Site prioritization using the {DBI} reveals that {CFR} sites protect Red Listed taxa rather well, despite the fact that catchments are only partially protected. The {DBI} demonstrates high levels of redundancy in representing Red Listed species, in other words, the same species are represented in several catchments. The value in the {DBI} thus lies in maximizing redundancy (i.e. representation) of globally Red Listed species. The rarity–complementarity algorithm represents all species, but without greater emphasis on the rare and threatened (i.e. Red Listed) species. We conclude that the {DBI} is of great value in selecting biodiversity hotspots, while the algorithm is useful for selecting complementarity hotspots. We identify protection gaps and thus recommend continued searches in centers of endemism and existing reserves, as well as gap areas. These searches will hone Red List assessments and identify priority sites, as well as monitor already-identiﬁed sites for changes in quality of habitat.},

	abstract = {Estimating absence locations of a species is important in conservation biology and conservation planning. For instance, using reliable absence as much as presence information, species distribution models can enhance their performance and produce more accurate predictions of the distribution of a species. Unfortunately, estimating reliable absence locations is difficult and often requires a deep knowledge of the species’ distribution and of its abiotic and biotic environmental preferences and tolerance. In this paper, we propose a methodology to reconstruct reliable absence information from presence-only information, and the conditions that those presence-only data have to meet to make this possible. Large species occurrence data collections (otherwise called occurrence datasets) contain high quality and expert-reviewed species observation records from scientific surveys. These surveys can be used to retrieve species presence locations, but they also record places where the species in their target list were not observed. Although these absences could be simply due to sampling variation, it is possible to intersect many of these reports to estimate true absence locations, i.e. those due to habitat unsuitability or geographical hindrances. In this paper, we present a method to generate reliable absence locations of this type for marine species, using scientific surveys reports contained in the Ocean Biogeographic Information System ({OBIS}), an authoritative species occurrence dataset. Our method spatially aggregates information from surveys focussing on the same target species. It detects absence locations for a given species as those locations in which repeated surveys (that included the species of interest in their target list) reported information only on other species. We qualitatively demonstrate the reliability of our method using distribution records of the Atlantic cod as a case study. Additionally, we quantitatively estimate its performance using another authoritative large species occurrence dataset, the Global Biodiversity Information Facility ({GBIF}). We also demonstrate that our approach has higher accuracy and presents complementary behaviour with respect to another method using environmental envelopes. Our process can support species distribution models (as well as other types of models, e.g. climate change models) by providing reliable data to presence/absence approaches. It can manage regional as well as global scale scenarios and runs within a collaborative e-Infrastructure (D4Science) that publishes it as-a-Service, allowing biologists to reproduce, repeat and share experimental results.},

	abstract = {Increased emphasis is being placed on developing effective biodiversity conservation tools for practical conservation planning. The mesofilter is such a biodiversity planning tool, but has yet to be fully explored to appreciate its effectiveness. The key premise of the mesofilter is that ecosystems contain certain physical elements that are specifically associated with a diversity of species. Identifying such mesofilters could therefore complement existing conservation planning tools such as coarse and fine filters. To explore the value of the mesofilter as an operational scale in conservation planning, we studied 18 remnant patches of endangered montane grassland in {KwaZulu}-Natal, South Africa, using the physical landscape feature of patch rockiness as an abiotic surrogate for biodiversity. The objective was to determine whether the mesofilter of rockiness can predict variation in species richness and composition for three dominant grassland taxa (plants, butterflies and grasshoppers) at the landscape scale. Variable levels of rockiness had significant interactions with all three focal taxa. Higher species richness of all taxa was closely associated with higher levels of rockiness in a patch. The rocky mesofilter only predicted significant differences in species composition for butterflies. Elevation was also important, possibly another mesofilter for plants and grasshoppers in this landscape. Synthesis and applications. The results indicate that the use of an abiotic surrogate such as rockiness can predict biodiversity value across multiple taxa. The mesofilter is therefore a valuable surrogacy and congruency tool for practical biodiversity conservation across this landscape and would likely have similar value if explored elsewhere. It also has value in the design and management of protected areas.},
