Changes following and reply to comments on previous submission (v1.0.3).

* changed "to chose" to "to choose" in the description as suggested

* added single quotes around package name in description as suggested

* a manuscript describing the package is in the publication process but not yet available. We will add the reference in the citation file and in the description field as suggested, as soon as it becomes available.

* added \value sections to the Rd files of the exported functions of the packages, explaining the function output.

* we added a running example for the map selection function based on example data now included in the package. We kept the \dontrun wrapper for the example in find_method, since interactive multiple-choice user input is necessary.

Thank you for the helpful comments and please excuse the inconveniences.
